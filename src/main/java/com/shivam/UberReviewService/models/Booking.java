        In a realistic model, every Booking is made with one Driver.
        So, booking table simply stores a driver_id column that points to the driver table.
        That way, we can fetch the driver info directly from the driver table â€” no need for a driver_bookings join table.

        to solve this we use mapped , which refers Owner class having foreign key
